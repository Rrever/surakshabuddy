## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Xplorer's`

### Team Members:  
- Nakul Kanhaiyya Dhande (GitHub - Rrever/ LinkedIn - Nakul Dhande / Role - backend ,frontend)  
- Manoj Anil Patil (GitHub / LinkedIn - Manoj Patil/ Role - backend ,frontend)  
- Mazhar Rashad Kakar (GitHub / LinkedIn - Mazhar Kakar  / Role - UI/Ux)  
*(Add links if you want)*

### Your Approach:  
üîµ Why We Chose This Problem:
We observed that most existing personal safety apps fail when there is no internet connection ‚Äî a critical limitation during emergencies in rural areas, basements, public transport, or disaster zones.
We wanted to create a system that ensures safety without depending solely on mobile data ‚Äî combining offline and online capabilities to maximize survival chances.
Our vision was to build an app that saves lives, not just alerts.

üîµ Key Challenges We Addressed:

Ensuring SOS triggers work even without internet connectivity.

Capturing and securely storing emergency evidence (audio/video) during critical moments.

Real-time alerting trusted contacts through SMS when apps usually depend on push notifications.

Seamless offline-to-online data syncing once network reconnects.

Integrating AI (Groq API) to transcribe audio evidence for legal or investigative support.

üîµ Pivots, Brainstorms, and Breakthroughs During Hacking:

Initial designs depended heavily on Firebase, but we pivoted to Supabase for more cost-effective, fast storage and database management.

While brainstorming offline solutions, we discovered Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) rescue mode to alert nearby users ‚Äî making true offline rescue possible.

Integrating Groq's Whisper model for instant speech-to-text transcription turned into a major breakthrough, strengthening the evidence system.

Optimized the UI for one-tap quick action, ensuring users can trigger SOS even under stress, with minimum steps and maximum reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend:  Flutter, FlutterFlow, Dart
- Backend:  Supabase (Authentication, Database, Storage)
- Database:   Supabase (Database, Storage)
- APIs:  Groq (Voice Transcription), OpenAI API
- Hosting: Supabase Hosting

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [ ] **Groq:** Capture Voice: Use the Web Speech API or Flutter voice input to record audio when the user presses the SOS button.

Send to Groq: Send the audio file to the Groq API for transcription.

Handle Transcription: Once Groq transcribes the voice, save the text to Supabase and include it in emergency messages (SMS/email) sent to contacts.
